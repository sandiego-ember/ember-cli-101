Welcome to Ember-CLI 101 workshop hosted by [San Diego Ember][] with help from our friends at [Ember-SC][].

This workshop is loosely guided by [Adolfo Builes'][abuiles] book Ember-CLI 101.  You can [get $10 off for San Diego Ember group][ember-cli 101 book].

## Pre-event setup instructions

0. [Install Git][git-scm]
0. [Install Node.js][node-install]
0. Setup NPM for non-sudo installation
    0. NPM is the node package manager.  It will automatically be installed when you install node.
    0. NPM installs packages *locally* (within the directory it is invoked in) for per-project modules, or *globally* for packages you want accessible everywhere.
    0. However, by default NPM installs global packages in a root-restricted location, requiring SUDO to install.  This creates a **huge** headache.  As an alternative, _before_ you install any packages, follow [this guide][npm-g-without-sudo] to configure your NPM to install in your home directory without requiring sudo.
0. Install Bower: `npm i -g bower`
0. Install Ember-CLI: `npm i -g ember-cli`
0. And create a new project named 'workshop': `ember new workshop`
0. Change directories into workshop: `cd workshop` and install your local dependencies with: `ember install`

## Goal: reduce the glue

Web application development can involve a lot of repetition.  Attempts to reduce the repetition involved in web development has given rise to a variety of scaffolding tools and best practices.  These scaffolding tools are all trying to do the same thing:  reduce the amount of work necessary to "get started" by providing a set of "best practices" that are enabled default.  These choices include things like:

0. Application directory structure
0. Generators for common components
0. Modularity choices (AMD/node modules/etc)
0. Build system
0. Asset compilation & minification
0. Testing framework and setup

## Ember-CLI

Ember-CLI provides choices for all of the aforementioned areas.  We'll dive into some of these choices in more detail later but at a high level Ember-CLI builds in:

0. A directory structure which we'll explore more later
0. Generators for all common components
0. ES6 modules transpiled to AMD
0. Broccoli build tool for builds. (Lightning fast and extensible with plugin architecture
0. Asset minification also via Broccoli.
0. QUnit for testing

### Modules

Modules allow you to divide logical portions of code into smaller, functional pieces and include them as needed. As your application grows, smaller pieces of functional code become easier to manage, support, maintain and test. To learn more about JS Modules, check out [jsmodules.io](http://jsmodules.io)

## Best practices

0. Code
    0. `camelCase` naming
    0. use modules, avoid globals
    0. reusable code → mixins, extend, add-ons
0. Files
    0. `kebab-case-naming.js`
    0. children in subdirectory → `routes/invoices/edit.js` & `routes/invoices/new.js`

## Project Organization: High level

Now that you have an Ember-CLI generated project, let's step inside and start exploring:

```console
$ cd workshop
$ ls -A
app               .bowerrc     dist           .git        node_modules  README.md    tmp
bower_components  Brocfile.js  .editorconfig  .gitignore  package.json  testem.json  .travis.yml
bower.json        config       .ember-cli     .jshintrc   public        tests        vendor
```

#### package.json and node_modules

The first things to notice is the file `package.json` and the directory `node_modules`. These are from NPM, and if you're new to NPM, take a look at what is in the `package.json` file.  This file contains information about what NPM modules are required to run and develop our app. You'll see that the packages needed for broccoli and Ember-CLI are specified here. When using Ember-CLI you won't often edit this directly. If you were to install any Ember-CLI addons yourself, you would see them show up in here as well. The packages specified in `package.json` will be installed in the `node_modules` directory.

#### bower.json and bower_components

The next thing to look at is the file `bower.json` and the `bower_components` directory. These are similar to `package.json` and `node_modules`. Bower has become the de facto standard for front-end package management and our Ember-CLI application will use it to manage many of our dependencies. If you open up `bower.json` you'll see that our application comes out of the box with not only Ember but jQuery, Ember Data (for data persistence), and QUnit (for testing).

#### tests

Ember-CLI comes out-of-the box with a testing framework and provides some helpers to make testing easier. You can test models, routes, controllers and components, and you can test user flows.

Unit tests allow us to focus on specific functionality of a module and do not require the entire Ember application be running. Acceptance tests, also called integration tests, are used to test the flow of your app. They emulate user interactions throughout your application and using helpers you can make assertions about the expected functionality.

#### public and vendor

You may be wondering where images, fonts and other miscellaneous asset files should go. The answer is the `public` directory. These will be served at the root of your application.

Similarly, you may have JavaScript or CSS dependencies that are not in bower. These can be stored in the `vendor` directory. Loading vendor files is not something we will cover in this workshop.

#### The 'app' directory

The app directory is where we're going to put all of our own code.  It is carefully structured with an appropriate place for each type of module:

```console
$ ls app
app.js          controllers     index.html      router.js       styles          views
components      helpers         models          routes          templates
```

Some of these may sound familiar to you, while others may be brand new.  Don't worry yet if you don't know what all of these different pieces are.  We'll get to them one by one.

## Ready to code!

0. `ember install` (if you didn't do this before)
0. `ember serve`
0. http://localhost:4200

## Install Bootstrap

Let's use Bootstrap to make our website look nice.  This step isn't strictly necessary but it'll make our application snazzier.

```console
$ bower install bootstrap --save
```

Now we need to include the Bootstrap CSS into our build process.  Let's add the following to our `Brocfile.js` below `var app = new EmberApp();` and above `module.exports = app.toTree();`:

```js
app.import('bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css');
```

Our `Brocfile.js` should look something like this now:

```js
/* global require, module */

var EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');

var app = new EmberApp();
app.import('bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css');
module.exports = app.toTree();
```

**ProTip™** Ember-CLI uses live-reloading to persist changes to the browser without the need of reloading. As long as `http://localhost:4200/` is open, you'll see changes immediately. Neat! However, if you edit `Brocfile.js`, like we just did in this step, you will need to **kill** and **restart** `ember serve`. Then refresh `http://localhost:4200/`.

The font of our header should have changed.

Now let's add a big header introducing our blog.  Let's update our `application.hbs` file to add a jumbotron header and wrap our page content in a Bootstrap `container`:

```handlebars
{% raw %}
<div class="jumbotron">
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Bernice's Blog</h1>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container">
  {{outlet}}
</div>
{% endraw %}
```

Our site should have refreshed in our web browser now, revealing a big header for our blog.

## Accessing our API with ember-data

Ember is a client side framework and so when we have data that we want to persist, we need a back-end API.  We want an API to serve up our blog posts and allow users to view and submit comments.

We could use fixtures or a mock API, but some friendly back-end developers have already made a working API for us so let's use that.

Our API is setup at https://sandiego-ember-cli-101.herokuapp.com supporting the following endpoints

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <colgroup>
        <col class="col-xs-1">
        <col class="col-xs-3">
        <col class="col-xs-5">
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Verb</th><th>path</th><th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>GET</td><td>/blog-posts</td><td>List of blog posts</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GET</td><td>/blog-posts/:id</td><td>Retrieve a post</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>PUT</td><td>/blog-posts/:id</td><td>Update a post</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>DELETE</td><td>/blog-posts/:id</td><td>Delete a post</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GET</td><td>/comments</td><td>List of blog comments</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>POST</td><td>/comments</td><td>Add a blog comment</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GET</td><td>/comments/:id</td><td>Retrieve a comment</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>PUT</td><td>/comments/:id</td><td>Update a comment</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>DELETE</td><td>/comments/:id</td><td>Delete a comment</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Our API uses `snake_case` in the JSON it sends, the convention for Ruby on Rails APIs. Ember expects everything to be `camelCase`, so how can we connect these two nicely? Fortunately, we can use an Ember Data adapter to consumer our API and adapt it to the style we use in Ember.

We can set up an adapter at the level of an individual model, but since we'll be using the same API for all our models, let's set one up for the entire application:

```console
$ ember generate adapter application
version: 0.2.2
  installing
    create app/adapters/application.js
  installing
    create tests/unit/adapters/application-test.js
```

Let's open up that adapter and see what is there:

```js
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({
});
```

We're using an Ember Data built-in adapter called the RESTAdapter. Building a custom adapter isn't too hard, but we don't need to because Ember Data already comes with an adapter designed to interact with Rails APIs.

Let's update our file to use this adapter:

```js
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.ActiveModelAdapter.extend();
```

Finally, to point our Ember app at the API we've set up, let's go back to our server, hit CTRL-C to stop it, and restart `ember serve` using the proxy option to point Ember to the API we want to access:

```console
$ ember serve --proxy https://sandiego-ember-cli-101.herokuapp.com
version: 0.2.2
Proxying to https://sandiego-ember-cli-101.herokuapp.com
Livereload server on port 35729
Serving on http://localhost:4200/
```

## Blog post model

### Make a blog post model

For our test application, we're going to create a blog.  Let's start off by using a generator to create a model for the blogPost.  We'll give it a couple of basic fields and take a look at what happens.

```console
$ ember generate model blogPost title:string body:string
installing
    create app/models/blog-post.js
installing
    create tests/unit/models/blog-post-test.js
```

OK, Ember-CLI has just created for us both a model file in `app/models` and a test file in `tests/unit/models`.  Let's take a look at the model and see what it contains:

```js
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  title: DS.attr('string'),
  body: DS.attr('string')
 });
 ```

What is that funky syntax?  `import DS from 'ember-data'` and `export default DSModel.extend()`?  Welcome to the world of tomorrow!

Those `import` and `export` statements use ECMAScript 6 module syntax. Thanks to the magic of transpilers, we can already use them today even though no browsers support ES6 yet.  This should look familiar if you have used Node.js or AMD modules, there's just slightly different syntax.  We're importing a module from 'ember-data' and calling it `DS`.  Then we're extending the `DS.Model` class and using that as our module export.

Our model specifies every field it should have, in this case `title` and `body`.  If we later decide we want another field (perhaps a published date) we just need to add it to our model:

```js
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  title: DS.attr('string'),
  body: DS.attr('string'),
  publishedDate: DS.attr('date')
});
```

### Test our blog post model
Testing can seem daunting if you put it off for too long so lets get right to it and write a test for that model we just created. Ember-CLI has us covered. When we generated our blog post model Ember-CLI also generated a test module for our model:

```console
$ ls tests/unit/models
blog-post-test.js
```

Pretty cool, huh? Let's open up `tests/unit/models/blog-post-test.js` and see what Ember-CLI generated for us:

```js
import {
  moduleForModel,
  test
} from 'ember-qunit';

moduleForModel('blog-post', {
  // Specify the other units that are required for this test.

});

test('it exists', function(assert) {
  var model = this.subject();
  // var store = this.store();
  assert.ok(!!model);
});
```

That looks like a lot! First is the `import` statement. This imports the `ember-qunit` package we need for writing our test.

The first section you see, `moduleForModel`, is where any necessary loading for the model testing will be done. Each test is self-contained, so any dependencies (for example if one model depends on another) must be defined here. We don't need to worry about this for our simple blog post model _yet_.

The next section, `test`, shows how we define an individual test. One test can have many assertions but should test only one thing. The generator created a default test which asserts that our model exists.

Since we have about as much as we can test in here already for our small model, let's make sure the tests pass by visiting `http://localhost:4200/tests` in your browser.

**ProTip™** If you ever need to know what generators are available, just type `ember help generate` and enjoy a deliciously long list of generating goodness.

## Adding blog posts to our homepage

### Create the route

If we want to see blog posts on our website, we need to render them into our HTML.  Ember's view layer places routes and their associated URLs front and center.  The way to show something is to create a route and associated template.

Let's start once again from a generator, this time for our index page route:

```console
$ ember generate route index
installing
  create app/routes/index.js
  create app/templates/index.hbs
installing
  create tests/unit/routes/index-test.js
```

This creates a few files for our index route and template file.

Looking at `app/routes/index.js` we see:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
});
```


### Update the template

Let's take a look at the template file that was generated for us in `app/templates/index.hbs`:

```handlebars
{% raw %}
{{outlet}}
{% endraw %}
```

Just this funky thing called `{% raw %}{{outlet}}{% endraw %}`.  Ember.js uses handlebars for templating, and the `outlet` variable is a special variable that Ember uses to say "insert any subtemplates here".  If you've done anything with Ruby on Rails, think `yield` and you'll be awfully close.  We're not adding any subtemplates to our `index` template so let's remove the `{% raw %}{{outlet}}{% endraw %}` and add a sample post:

```html
<article>
  <header class="page-header">
    <h2>My Blog Post</h2>
  </header>
  <p>This is a test post.</p>
</article>
```

Go look at the website in your browser again. Our 'My Blog Post' header should appear nicely beneath our big site header.

### Putting our posts on the page

So far we have only put some HTML on our page. Let's use the API to show our actual blog posts.

First let's add a `model` to our route in `app/routes/index.js`. One of the jobs of routes is to provide a model to their template. Our model should be a list of blog posts retrieved from our API.

We could manually provide list of blog posts as our model:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function() {
    return [{
      title: "First post",
      body: "This is the post body."
    }];
  }
});
```

Instead let's use the data store to retrieve all of our blog posts:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function() {
    return this.store.find('blog-post');
  }
});
```

Now we should update our index template to loop over each of our blog posts and render it:

```handlebars
{% raw %}
{{#each model as |post|}}
  <article>
    <header class="page-header">
      <h2>{{post.title}}</h2>
    </header>
    <p>{{post.body}}</p>
  </article>
{{/each}}
{% endraw %}
```

The handlebars each helper allows us to enumerate over a list of items.  This should print out all of our blog posts to the page.  Let's check out our homepage in our browser again and make sure it worked.

![display all blog posts](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/0e0w0u2b2o3d0r47301y/Screen%20Shot%202015-03-31%20at%201.45.32%20PM.png)

## Additional Blog post route(s)

What if we want to share a link to one of our blog posts?  To do that, we would need a page for each blog post.  Let's make those!

### Create the route

Let's start by using a generator to make the new files we'll need:

```console
$ ember generate route blogPost --type=resource --path=/post/:blog_post_id
version: 0.2.2
installing
  create app/routes/blog-post.js
    create app/templates/blog-post.hbs
    installing
      create tests/unit/routes/blog-post-test.js
```

This creates a few files, and also adds some stuff to your  `app/router.js`:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';
import config from './config/environment';

var Router = Ember.Router.extend({
  location: config.locationType
});

export default Router.map(function() {
  this.resource('blogPost', {
    path: '/post/:blog_post_id'
  }, function() {});
});
```

Here it has defined a resource for us with a dynamic segment in the route, `:blog_post_id`. This dynamic segment will be extracted from the URL and passed into the `model` hook on the `post` route. We can then use this parameter to look up that exact `blog-post` in the store. So let's open up `app/routes/blog-post.js` that was generated for us and do just that.

```js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function(params) {
    return this.store.find('blog-post', params.blog_post_id);
  }
});
```


### Update the template

In order to make sure this is working, let's add some markup to `app/templates/blog-post.hbs` that will display a post:

```handlebars
{% raw %}
<article>
  <header class="page-header">
    <h1>{{model.title}}</h1>
  </header>
  <p>{{model.body}}</p>
</article>
{% endraw %}
```

Since we happen to know there is a blog post with `id: 1` on our API server, we can manually visit `http://localhost:4200/post/1` in our browser to test with an example blog post.

### The magic of Ember-Data

Ember-Data's REST Adapter comes with some freebies to save us time and unnecessary code. The adapter that we are using, `ActiveModelAdapter` is an extension of the REST Adapter, so we get to take advantage of this automagic if our application follows the URL conventions expected of the REST Adapter.

Based on our route's dynamic URL segments the REST Adapter will make the proper calls to the application's API for the model hook.

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <colgroup>
        <col class="col-xs-2">
        <col class="col-xs-2">
        <col class="col-xs-8">
    </colgroup>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Action</td>
      <td>HTTP Verb</td>
      <td>URL</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Find</td>
      <td>GET</td>
      <td>/post/:blog_post_id</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Find All</td>
      <td>GET</td>
      <td>/post</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Update</td>
      <td>PUT</td>
      <td>/post/:blog_post_id</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Create</td>
      <td>POST</td>
      <td>/post</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Delete</td>
      <td>DELETE</td>
      <td>/post/:blog_post_id</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**ProTip™** The store action determines the model name based on the defined dynamic segment. In our example `:blog_post_id` contains the proper snake-case name for our model with the suffix `_id` appended.

To confirm that this works, **delete the `app/routes/blog-post.js` file** and verify that our blog post page (http://localhost:4200/post/1) still works properly after reload.

NOTE:  Ember-CLI created a route test file automatically as well.  To make sure your tests continue to pass, if you delete `app/routes/blog-post.js` you should also delete `tests/unit/routes/blog-post-test.js`

### Handlebars link-to helper

Now that we have unique URLs for each blog post, we can link to these URLs from our index route.

To add these links open up the `app/templates/index.hbs` file and add a `link-to` Handlebars helper around our blog title:

```handlebars
{% raw %}
{{#each model as |post|}}
  <article>
    <h2>{{#link-to 'blogPost' post}}{{post.title}}{{/link-to}}</h2>
    {{post.body}}
  </article>
{{/each}}
{% endraw %}
```

Now take a look at `http://localhost:4200` and a link should appear. **Click it!** And now you're at the page for our blog post.

### Acceptance testing

With some user interaction added to our application we can now create an acceptance test. The user flow for this test will be:

0. Visit `/`
0. Click the first blog link
0. Verify that the URL now matches `/post/:blog_post_id`

First we will have to generate our acceptance test.

```console
$ ember generate acceptance-test blog-post-show
installing
  create tests/acceptance/blog-post-show-test.js
```

Open the created file `tests/acceptance/blog-post-show-test.js` and see what is there:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';
import {
  module,
  test
} from 'qunit';
import startApp from 'workshop/tests/helpers/start-app';

var application;

module('Acceptance: BlogPostShow', {
  beforeEach: function() {
    application = startApp();
  },

  afterEach: function() {
    Ember.run(application, 'destroy');
  }
});

test('visiting /blog-post-show', function(assert) {
  visit('/blog-post-show');

  andThen(function() {
    assert.equal(currentPath(), 'blog-post-show');
  });
});
```

Let's first rename this test to something more applicable and remove the stuff inside.

```js
test('visit blog post from index', function(assert) {

});
```

There are a few helpers here that we will use **a lot** when writing acceptance tests.

* `visit(route)`: Visits the given route
* `click(selector or element)`: Clicks the element and triggers any actions triggered by that element's click event
* `andThen(callback)`: Waits for any preceding promises to continue

Since `visit` and `click` are both asynchronous helpers we need to wrap subsequent logic in `andThen` to make sure actions complete before continuing onto the next step.

Now we will code out the steps listed above to test that we can link to a blog post from index.

```js
test('visit blog post from index', function(assert) {
  visit('/');
  var blogSelector = 'article:first-of-type a';

  andThen(function() {
    click(blogSelector);
  });

  andThen(function() {
    assert.equal(currentURL(), '/post/1');
  });
});
```

Verify the tests are passing by visiting `http://localhost:4200/tests` in the browser.

## Blog comments

### Make a comment model
We want users to be able to comment on blog posts. We've seen how to use `ember generate model` before to create our models. In this case, we want the comment to be a `string`, and our Rails API defines the content of these comments as `content`.

```console
$ ember generate model comment content:string
installing
    create app/models/comment.js
installing
    create tests/unit/models/comment-test.js
```

We've seen this before.  Let's take a look at the model and see what it contains:

```js
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  content: DS.attr('string')
 });
```

But our comments need to be aware of our blog posts, and vice versa. We're going to add a one-to-many relationship which is built into Ember Data for us.

The comments need a `DS.belongsTo` since a comment belongs to a blog post:

```js
export default DS.Model.extend({
  content: DS.attr('string'),
  blogPost: DS.belongsTo('blogPost')
});
```

Whereas the blog posts need a `DS.hasMany` since a blog post has many comments:

```js
export default DS.Model.extend({
  title: DS.attr('string'),
  body: DS.attr('string'),
  publishedDate: DS.attr('date'),
  comments: DS.hasMany('comment')
});
```

Ember has a number of different ways to define relationships like this. You can [learn more here](http://guides.emberjs.com/v1.11.0/models/defining-models/#toc_defining-relationships).

But, this isn't going to work as we have it! Remember how our API endpoints were `GET /blog_posts/:id` and `GET /comments/:id`? Our API response returns something like this:

```json
{
    "blog_post": {
        "id":2,
        "title": "Hello, World",
        "body": "Some body!",
        "published_date" :null,
        "comment_ids": [1]
    }
}
```

Whomever built our API has decided to keep it really lightweight and not embed the comments inside the blog posts. This means we need to fetch the comments for these posts by hitting `GET /comments/:id` for every comment on our post.

Ember Data calls this an asynchronous relationship, and we need to update our model in `app/models/blog-post.js` accordingly:

```js
export default DS.Model.extend({
  // We just need to change the `DS.hasMany` to be async
  comments: DS.hasMany('comment', {async: true})
});
```

This tells Ember Data to do exactly what we said above: fetch the comments for these posts by hitting `GET /comments/:id` for every comment on our post. This happens asynchronously, meaning that while the blog post content has loaded, the comments may take a moment to load.

#### Let the tests know about these dependencies

Remember when we had only one model, with no relationships to other models? Those are easy to unit test in isolation. At this point, unfortunately, your tests should be failing, because they can't find either the `comment` dependency or `blogPost` dependency. When the tests need related models, you must tell Ember's test runner to load these dependencies.

Find the following block in `tests/unit/models/blog-post-test.js`.

```js
moduleForModel('blog-post', {
  // Specify the other units that are required for this test.
  needs: []
});
```

You must fill out the `needs` property. To tell Ember about the comment dependency:

```js
  needs: ['model:comment']
```

For the same block in `tests/unit/models/comment-test.js`, to tell Ember about the blog post dependency:

```js
  needs: ['model:blogPost']
```

### Show comments on a blog post

Let's get comments to show up on a blog post by adding to our `app/templates/blog-post.hbs`:

```handlebars
{% raw %}
<article>
  <header class="page-header">
    <h1>{{model.title}}</h1>
  </header>
  <p>{{model.body}}</p>

  <h2>Comments</h2>
  <ul>
  {{#each model.comments as |comment|}}
    <li>{{comment.content}}</li>
  {{/each}}
  </ul>
</article>
{% endraw %}
```

We first loop through all the `model.comments` with Ember's (relatively new) syntax, defining `|comment|` as the local variable we use to access each `comment` model. Inside of this loop, we output the comment content we defined in our model with `content: DS.attr('string')` with `{% raw %}{{comment.content}}{% endraw %}`.

But we also want a good user experience for our readers. They need to know when comments are being loaded and when there aren't any comments at all!

For the loading case, we have to think about sort of object our `model.comments` happens to be. It's a [`PromiseManyArray`](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.PromiseManyArray.html), and in our templates we can hook into [`PromiseProxyMixin`](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.PromiseProxyMixin.html)'s loading states. We're given access to: `isPending`, `isSettled`, `isRejected`, and `isFulfilled`.

We can update our template to make use of this new property:

```handlebars
{% raw %}
  <h2>Comments</h2>
  {{#if model.comments.isPending}}
    <p>Loading...</p>
  {{else}}
    <ul>
    ...
    </ul>
  {{/if}}
{% endraw %}
```

Now our users know when comments are still loading and aren't presented with an ugly empty list of comments. If we wanted to go above and beyond, we could add a loading indicator here to indicate the comments are being loaded, but we'll move on.

We also want to handle the empty case, which is a lot easier. We can make use of Handlebars' `{{#if something}} {{else}} {{/if}}` syntax here:

```handlebars
{% raw %}
  <h2>Comments</h2>
  {{#if model.comments.isPending}}
    <p>Loading...</p>
  {{else}}
    {{#if model.comments}}
      <ul>
      {{#each model.comments as |comment|}}
        <li>{{comment.content}}</li>
      {{/each}}
      </ul>
    {{else}}
      <p>There are no comments yet.</p>
    {{/if}}
  {{/if}}
{% endraw %}
```

If there are comments, we iterate over them. If there are none, we add a helpful message to the user to let them know there aren't any comments yet.

#### Avoiding multiple GET requests for comments

Remember once more how we were hitting `GET /comments/:id` for every comment on our post? Our API developer probably didn't expect us to make 101 server requests every time we hit a blog post with 100 comments.

Ember Data once again has solved our use case with [`coalesceFindRequests`](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.ActiveModelAdapter.html#property_coalesceFindRequests), which lumps all of our individual `GET` requests together into a single request. If you had a `blogPost` like the following:

```json
{
  "blogPost": {
    "id": 1,
    "comment_ids": [1, 2]
  }
}
```

...and set `coalesceFindRequests` to `true` at the adapter level, Ember Data will transform our outbound requests to:

```
GET /comments?ids[]=1&ids[]=2
```

Let's do that now. Open up `app/adapters/application.js` and modify it to set `coalesceFindRequests` to `true`:

```js
export default DS.ActiveModelAdapter.extend({
  coalesceFindRequests: true
});
```

That's it! Our Ember app now automatically hits a single URL for all the comments for a given post.

Not that we haven't written any acceptance tests. We should, but in the interest of time this is left as an exercise for you.

## Submitting a comment

We can see existing comments on our blog but users have no way to submit comments yet!  Let's make a form for users to submit comments.

First let's add a form to our template right before our closing `</article>` tag:

```handlebars
{% raw %}
<hr>

<form {{action 'addComment' on='submit'}}>
  <div class="form-group">
    {{textarea value=commentContent class='form-control' rows='3'}}
  </div>
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Add My Comment!</button>
</form>
{% endraw %}
```

We need to handle our `addComment` action and actually save a new comment.  We should use a controller to handle this action.  Let's generate a controller for our blog post page:

```console
$ ember generate controller blog-post
installing
  create app/controllers/blog-post.js
  installing
    create tests/unit/controllers/blog-post-test.js
```

Now let's open up a controller file and add our action:

```javascript
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  actions: {
    addComment: function() {
      var controller = this;
      this.store.createRecord('comment', {
        blogPost: this.get('content'),
        content: this.get('commentContent')
      }).save().then(function() {
        controller.set('commentContent', '');
      });
    }
  }
});
```

That's some chaining!  What's going on here?

So our `addComment` action first creates a `Comment` record and puts it in our `ember-data` store in our browser, with the blog post and comment content text fields filled in.  Nothing has been submitted to the server at this point.

Our `createRecord` call returns our newly created comment model.  On this model we immediately call `save` to save it to the server, creating our new comment.  The `save` call returns a promise that will resolve when the API call returns with a success response.  By using our promise's `then` function, we supplied a function to call after our promise resolves.  Our post-resolve function will clear out the comment content so we can submit another comment if we wish.

## Where do I go next?

As we said at the beginning, you can [get $10 off for San Diego Ember group][ember-cli 101 book] for the Ember-CLI 101 book. This is a great next step for understanding all the internals of `ember-cli`. Adolfo, the author, is always updating the book to stay current with `ember-cli`.

The Ember guides are great for diving deep once you understand the fundamentals. They're always improving and will be the most up-to-date resource you can use. :)
